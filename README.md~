[CakePHP](http://www.cakephp.org) is a rapid development framework for PHP which
uses commonly known design patterns like Associative Data
Mapping, Front Controller, and MVC.  Our primary goal is to provide a structured
framework that enables PHP users at all levels to rapidly develop robust web
applications, without any loss to flexibility.

## Installing CakePHP via Composer

You can install CakePHP into your project using
[Composer](http://getcomposer.org).  If you're starting a new project, we
recommend using the [app skeleton](https://github.com/cakephp/app) as
a starting point. For existing applications you can run the following:

``` bash
$ composer require cakephp/cakephp:"~3.3"
```

## Running Tests
